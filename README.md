# Web Lessons

## Guides Goal

This guide is aimed toward those new to web developement, or very the early beginner and works its way from there onwards. **NOTE** This is not a definite guide, or a replacement for other learning sites.
In general this lesson set is being built for a young friend and I am building it open source, so anyone can learn from it, use it, give suggestions on improvements, or anything OSS style to improve this work for those that find it and want to learn from it.
> There is never a time to early to start, and there is never a time to late to begin.

## Vision

> To be a trustworthy place to come to learn about web development, from beginner all the way to where we as developers are willing to share openly. By bringing tips, articles, and lessons together that help those starting out and (eventually)beyond hone their developer skills.

## Mission Statement

> Lesson-Web's mission is to help those on their way to web mastery, by means providing web knowledge and standards, links too and articles about helpful web information to provide accurate knowledge. We want to inspire and grow the web and other areas as permitted while providing a bond with those who use our site that they will expand their knowledge with beneficial knowledge.

### Note of Works Published

**NOTE** this is a living document, with that said some documents that are _publishished Now_ could become _deprecated_ in the future due to rapid web developement changes... this can be due to many reasons, from new knowledge, findings, updates in browsers, SEO changes, and much much more. Myself and anyone who works on this project will try to keep our findings published and which browswers are effected when things are released. But please remember the web world is volatile and sometimes things that are the **in thing* now...can be _out of style_ very very fast.
